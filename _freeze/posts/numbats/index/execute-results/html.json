The main source of their food - termites - are active during the daytime hours. For this reason, numbats are also diurnal in order to be able to feed upon termites in the shallow galleries. They typically spend mid-morning and late afternoon feeding and wandering. Meanwhile, in summer and spring, numbats are known to be active for longer periods of time during the day, taking only a short rest during mid-day in their shelters. During autumn and winter, their routine moves slightly: in this period, they are usually active later in the morning, returning to their shelters earlier in the afternoon and then remaining active during mid-day. This flexibility of their habits suggests that numbats try to minimize thermoregulatory costs and derive maximum benefit from the daylight, consuming as many termites as possible. \"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> ##### Habits and Lifestyle\nNumbats are generally solitary animals, socializing only when raising their offspring and during the mating seaosn, when a breeding pair lives in a nest.

They breed in December - January. Gestation period lasts for 14 days, yielding 4 babies, which live attached to their mother's body for the first 6 months of their lives. And when young are so heavy and large, that the female cannot walk with them on her body, she removes the babies, after which they start living in a log or burrow, where the mother regularly visits them, continuing to protect and suckle her offspring, until they are 8 - 9 months old. They spend the following 2 months exploring the environment, coming out of their nest to eat termites and experiencing their first encounters with predators. Finally, at 10 - 11 months old, young numbats are weaned from maternal milk. They leave their mother at 1 year old in order to find territories of their own, forage and breed. Sexual maturity is reached at 1 year old in females and at 2 years old - in males. \"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> ##### Mating Habits\nNumbats have a polygynous mating system, where one male mates with multiple females.

This could have resulted from a data bias. Perhaps, most of the expeditions to sight the numbats were conducted during that interval.
